# To-Do App

This is a simple **To-Do List application** developed as part of a class assignment. The app allows users to add and delete tasks, with all the data being stored locally in the browser using **Local Storage**.

## Features
- **Add Tasks:** Users can add tasks to the list.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Local Storage:** Tasks persist between page reloads using local storage, meaning your to-dos will not be lost even when you refresh or close the browser.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile browsers.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structuring the page.
- **CSS** for styling and making the app visually appealing.
- **JavaScript** for functionality.
- **Local Storage API** to store the to-do items in the browser.

## How to Use
1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Type your task in the input field and click on "Add Task".
3. Your task will be added to the to-do list.
4. The list will automatically save your tasks in your browser's local storage, so they will be available even if you refresh the page or reopen the browser later.
